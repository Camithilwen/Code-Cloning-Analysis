## Experimentation Dataset

The 'experimentation dataset' contains pairs of C++ code samples that were curated the from the 'training dataset' (i.e., the Project CodeNet C++ 1000 benchmark) for use in the Call for Code Spot Challenge for CodeNet. This 'experimentation dataset' is comprised of 50% similar pairs (i.e., solve the same problem) and 50% dissimilar pairs (i.e., solve different problems). It is in the same general format that the 'dev phase' and 'final phase' test datasets will be in with a few differences.

This dataset contains a directory called `data`, which contains a subdirectory for each problem number, e.g., `p03023`. The individual code samples reside within the appropriate problem number directories. The problem number directories will not be present in the 'dev phase' and 'final phase' test datasets. There is a file called `pairs.csv`, which has three columns: 'pair-id', 'file1', and 'file2'. The file paths for the code samples in the columns labeled 'file1' and 'file2'  are relative to the `data` directory (e.g., `p02761/s682789980.cpp`). Finally, there is a file called `ground_truth.csv`, which will not be present in the 'dev phase' and 'final phase'. `ground_truth.csv` contains the correct predictions for each pair id. The 'pair-id' column in `ground_truth.csv` corresponds to the 'pair-id' column in `pairs.csv`. In `ground_truth.csv`, the 'similar' column contains '1' when the two solutions solve the same problem and a '0' when the solutions solve different problems.
