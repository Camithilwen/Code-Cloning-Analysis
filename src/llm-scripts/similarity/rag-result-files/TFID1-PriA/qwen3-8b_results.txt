Okay, let me try to figure out how to assess the similarity between the target code and the three similar code snippets. The user wants a score from 0 to 1, with an explanation.

First, I need to understand what the target code is. The target code seems to be a part of a license text, specifically mentioning the GNU General Public License (GPL). It talks about freedom to share and change software, ensuring it's free for all users. The text is cut off at the end, but the main theme is about software licensing.

Now, looking at Similar Code 1. It's a shell script snippet related to installing and uninstalling files, using commands like echo, find, xargs, sed. There are variables like DESTDIR and steps for uninstalling. This doesn't seem related to a license text, but rather build or installation scripts.

Similar Code 2 is about a GitHub Actions workflow for testing. It has sections like "Basic Install", on: push and pull request triggers, jobs with runs-on, strategies for os matrix. It's a CI/CD configuration and not related to the license text.

Similar Code 3 is about contributing to a project called cowsay. It has sections on code of conduct, contributions, and mentions the Contributor Covenant and Homebrew's Code of Conduct. This is documentation for contributing to a project, not related to the license text.

So, comparing all three similar codes with the target code. The target is about a GPL license, which is a type of software license. None of the similar codes are about licenses. The first one is build scripts, second is CI/CD, third is contribution guidelines.

Therefore, the degree of similarity is very low. The target code is about a specific license text, while the similar codes are about different topics (installation scripts, CI setup, contribution docs). There's no direct similarity in content or structure. So the score should be close to 0. Maybe 0.1 if there's any overlap, but given the context, they are unrelated.

**Score:** 0.1  
**Explanation:** The target code is a fragment of the GNU General Public License (GPL), focusing on software freedom and licensing. The similar code snippets are unrelated:  
- **Similar Code 1** involves shell scripts for file management (installation/uninstall), unrelated to licenses.  
- **Similar Code 2** is a GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration for testing, with no connection to licensing.  
- **Similar Code 3** discusses project contribution guidelines and code of conduct, not licenses.  

While all three snippets are technical in nature, they address entirely different domains (license text vs. build scripts, CI/CD, and contribution docs). The only minimal overlap is the use of terms like "free" or "software," but these are contextually and structurally distinct. Thus, the similarity score is very low (0.1).
