Type-1: The provided target code is a paragraph from the GNU General Public License (GPL). Similar Code 1 does not contain any text that matches this paragraph. So, it does not have Type-1 similarity.

Type-2: There are no variable or function names in the target code to compare with other codes. Therefore, Type-2 similarity is not applicable.

Type-3: The provided codes do not share any statements or lines at a syntactic level that match the target code. So, there's no Type-3 similarity.

Type-4: None of the similar codes perform the same function as described in the target code. The target code is a paragraph explaining the rights and conditions under which software can be distributed or modified, while Similar Codes 1, 2, and 3 do not involve any software distribution or modification. Therefore, there's no Type-4 similarity.

Overall score: Since none of the types apply to these codes, the overall score is 0.
